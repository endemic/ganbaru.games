                <p>
                    Let's Build Bridges is a collection of logic puzzles, also known
                    as Hashi, Bridges, or Chopsticks. The goal of each puzzle is to
                    connect all the "islands" by drawing a series of "bridges"
                    between them. The rules are:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Bridges must start and end at an island.</li>
                    <li>Bridges can only be drawn in straight lines (not diagonally!)</li>
                    <li>Bridges cannot cross each other.</li>
                    <li>At most, two bridges can be drawn between islands.</li>
                    <li>The number of bridges connected to each island must match the number on the island.</li>
                    <li>The bridges must connect <strong>all</strong> the islands together.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The first few puzzles are easy, but watch out, as the difficulty
                    ramps up quickly! There are 100 puzzles to solve. Have fun
                    building bridges!

                    Are you a puzzle maniac? Do you eat Japanese logic games like
                    sudoku and nonograms for breakfast? Give Shikaku Madness a try.
                    It's a fun and challenging game, with lots of unique puzzles to
                    solve. Bust your brain as you try to figure out how to
                    completely cover the game grid using squares and rectangles.
                    Sound complicated? Don't worry! The first few levels provide an
                    interactive tutorial to help new players learn the rules.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Click &amp; drag on the puzzle grid to draw. Each
                    number on the grid is a clue; the number represents the size of
                    the rectangle that overlaps it. For example, a clue of "9" means
                    that you need to draw a 3x3 square on top of that clue. The
                    trick is to draw each square and rectangle so that there's no
                    wasted space on the grid. You can't overlap squares, either.
                    Fortunately, there's no time limit, and you can always try again
                    if you make a mistake.

                    A fun &amp; challenging puzzle game; best described as a mix
                    between sudoku and crosswords. Use the provided clues to fill in
                    the correct blocks in the grid, revealing a hidden picture.
                    Complete the included "easy" difficulty puzzles, and if you're
                    up to the challenge, unlock the "medium" and "hard" difficulties
                    for hours of puzzling fun. Includes an interactive tutorial to
                    get beginners up to speed. Think you're a nonogram master? Try
                    solving the randomly generated puzzles for infinite replay value!
                </p>

                <p>
                    The goal of a nonogram puzzle is to "fill" all the correct
                    blocks in a grid. The key to solving each puzzle is the numbers
                    on the top and left of the grid. Each number gives you a clue
                    about how many blocks are filled in each row or column. For
                    example, if the clue for a row was "4 3 1", that means there are
                    four sequentially filled blocks, a gap of one (or more), three
                    filled blocks, another gap, and then finally one filled block on
                    its own. In a 10x10 puzzle grid, this clue solves the whole row:
                    4 filled + 1 blank + 3 filled + 1 blank + 1 filled = 10 total.
                    Solve easy clues first, then you can logically fill in the rest
                    of the blocks in the grid.
