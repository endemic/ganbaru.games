<p>Feeling bored with mobile games lately? I know I've been. Aside from a few gems (some of which, like Final Fantasy Tactics, are console ports), most mobile games these days take a simple mechanic, beat it like a dead horse, then sell it to you via IAP. Imagine my excitement when <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keroblaster/id867598817?mt=8" title="Kero Blaster on iTunes">Kero Blaster</a> was recently released. A new sidescrolling platformer from Daisuke Amaya? Sign me up!</p>
<p>For those living under a rock, Daisuke Amaya (otherwise known by his pseudonym, Pixel), helped kick-start the indie game scene by releasing his masterpiece, Cave Story, for free 10 years ago. Cave Story was a love letter to the games Amaya (and the rest of us) grew up playing, such as Mario, Castlevania, and Metroid. With its' charming characters, engaging story, and surprising length, Cave Story really stole the hearts of a lot of game players, myself included.</p>
<p>It seems like a no-brainer, then, that if you loved Cave Story, you'd jump at the chance to play another, similar game (designed by the same guy, no less). And that's basically all there is to say about Kero Blaster. As the protagonist, an anthropomorphic frog, your goal is to remove the strange, black creatures that have invaded your company's various locations. As you progress, your character collects coins, which can be used to upgrade weapons and health.</p>
