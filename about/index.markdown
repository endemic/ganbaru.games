<p>Ganbaru Games is a one-person game company based in Columbus, Ohio, currently focused on making games for iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad (or "iOS," if you will) devices.</p>
<p>Why make games? There's something satisfying about creating little "worlds" that other people can experience. Some people do this with the written word, or other artistic mediums, but my medium is the electronic game.</p>
<p>"Ganbaru" is a Japanese word that is loosely translated as "to try one's best," which is the philosophy that I'd like to bring to game-making.</p>
